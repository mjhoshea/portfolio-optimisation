RL Based Portfolio Optimisation
==============================

This repository contains the code for the thesis -
'Reinforcement Learning for Portfolio Optimisation: A Natural Gradient Dirichlet Approach'. This 
was completed as part the Computational Statistics and Machine Learning MSc at UCL.

To Run Locally
------------

The computational overhead of running the models is low enough to run on a personal machine. For that reason 
all code is run in exploratory notebooks. Please see the notebooks directory.
